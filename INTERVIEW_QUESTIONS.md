User Validation Interview Questions
Questions for MSD Workers
Current Process Understanding:

Walk me through what happens when someone experiencing homelessness contacts you for emergency housing support. What are the actual steps?
How do you currently coordinate with KƒÅinga Ora? Email? Phone? Shared systems?
How long does the coordination typically take from first contact to housing placement?
What information do you need to collect from the person? Do they have to provide this multiple times to different agencies?

Pain Points:
5. What's the most frustrating part of the current coordination process?
6. Where do people typically fall through the cracks or get delayed?
7. How often do you lose track of where someone is in the process across agencies?
System Reaction:
8. (Show them the demo at eleutherios-mvp.vercel.app/onboarding) What's your immediate reaction to this approach?
9. Would you actually use a shared forum like this to coordinate with KO and the person? Why or why not?
10. What would need to be different for you to consider using this in your daily work?
11. What are the barriers to adoption? (Technology? Policy? Training? Privacy concerns?)
Practical Constraints:
12. What systems are you required to use currently? Could you use something additional, or would this need to replace existing systems?
13. Do you have authority to pilot new coordination tools, or would this need approval from management?
14. What privacy or compliance requirements would this need to meet?
Critical Commitment Question:
15. "If I built this and wanted to run a trial with 3 homeless people requesting emergency housing, would you commit to participating and responding within 24 hours for a 2-week trial period?"

Questions for Shelter/Service Providers
Current Operations:

How do people currently request a bed/shower/meal from your service?
How do you decide who gets access when you're at capacity?
Do you coordinate with MSD or other agencies? How?

Capacity Reality:
4. How often are you at full capacity?
5. If someone requests a bed through an app at 8pm and you're full, what happens?
6. Would having requests come through a system like this help or create more work for you?
System Reaction:
7. (Show demo) Would you respond to requests that came through this system?
8. What would you need from a technical tool to make your coordination easier?
9. What would make this more work instead of less work for you?
Pilot Willingness:
10. If we ran a small trial with 2-3 people, would you participate?
11. What would need to be true for you to say yes to that trial?
Critical Commitment Question:
12. "If someone requested emergency shelter through this, would you commit to checking and responding within 2 hours for a 2-week trial?"

Questions for Homeless People
Current Experience:

When you've sought help with housing/shelter, what was that process like?
Who did you have to talk to? What forms did you fill out?
Did you feel like you knew what was happening or where you were in the process?

Technology Access:
4. Do you have a phone? Can you access internet (where - library, shelter, data plan)?
5. Are you comfortable using apps or websites?
6. Have you used apps to access services before?
System Reaction:
7. (Show demo - keep it brief) Does this make sense to you?
8. Would you be willing to try requesting services through something like this?
9. What concerns would you have about using an app for this?
Critical Commitment Question:
10. "If this system existed and I asked you to try using it for 2 weeks to request housing/shelter, would you do it?"

What You're Looking For:

At least ONE MSD worker who says "yes, I'd try this"
At least ONE service provider who says "yes, I'd respond to requests"
Evidence that the current coordination is actually broken
Specific requirements you'd need to meet

Red Flags:

"Interesting idea, but..." (means no)
"We'd need approval from management" (6+ months of bureaucracy)
"Privacy regulations wouldn't allow this" (fundamental blocker)
Vague enthusiasm without concrete commitment

The goal is finding people who will commit to a 2-week trial with 2-3 people. If nobody will commit to even that, it tells you something important about whether this solves a real problem they have.
