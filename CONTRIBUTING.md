# Contributing to Eleutherios

Kia ora and welcome — thank you for your interest in contributing to **Eleutherios**.  
This project is an open-source prototype of a shared governance platform, built around the principle of **Prior Unity** and the Policy → Forum → Service → Data architecture.

We welcome contributions from developers, designers, researchers, and community members.  
Please read the following guidelines to help us keep collaboration clear and productive.

---

## Ways to Contribute

- **Code**: Improve the backend (Firebase/Firestore, Cloud Functions) or frontend (React/Next.js).  
- **Documentation**: Clarify architecture, expand schema, or add tutorials.  
- **Design**: UX/UI metaphors for the Policy Editor and Policy-to-Service flow.  
- **Research**: Insights into governance models, Māori frameworks, and sustainability practices.  
- **Community**: Share ideas, test prototypes, and give feedback.

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Code style**  
   - Use clear, modular JavaScript/TypeScript for frontend and Firebase functions.  
   - Follow functional naming conventions (e.g. `deleteUserPolicyBreadcrumbReference`).  
   - Add comments where recursion, async, or schema rules are involved.

3. **Commit messages**  
   Use conventional commit style:  
   - `feat:` new feature  
   - `fix:` bug fix  
   - `docs:` documentation only  
   - `refactor:` code change without new features  
   - `test:` adding or fixing tests  

4. **Push and open a Pull Request**  
   - Describe what you’ve done and reference related issues.  
   - Pull Requests will be reviewed by maintainers before merging.

## Issues

- Use GitHub Issues for bugs, feature requests, or questions.  
- Tag your issue with one of: `bug`, `feature`, `documentation`, `discussion`.

## Community Guidelines

- Respect the kaupapa of **Governance through Love in Action**.  
- Contributions should align with the principle of **Prior Unity / Tino Rangatiratanga**.  
- Be constructive, transparent, and inclusive.
