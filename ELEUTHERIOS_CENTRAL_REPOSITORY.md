Yes, that's a compelling architectural possibility that emerges from the EleuScript design. A central policy repository could work several ways:
Technical Implementation:

Policy Templates: Proven coordination patterns like Policy('HealthcareConsultation') or Policy('HousingCoordination') become reusable templates
Inheritance Hierarchies: Policies can inherit from base templates and customize for specific contexts
Version Control: Policy evolution tracked with governance transparency
Discovery Mechanism: Search and recommendation system for relevant policies

Network Effects:

Proven Patterns: Healthcare forums worldwide could use the same tested PrescriptionFulfillment policy
Local Adaptation: Policy('HealthcareConsultation_NZ') inherits from global template but adds New Zealand-specific compliance
Cross-Domain Learning: Housing coordination patterns inform emergency response policies
Quality Metrics: Policies rated by coordination success and stakeholder satisfaction

Governance Considerations:
The repository raises important questions about control and standardization:

Who maintains the canonical RefundPolicy or DataPrivacy templates?
How do local regulations and cultural contexts get accommodated?
What prevents policy fragmentation or conflicting standards?
How do communities maintain autonomy while benefiting from shared patterns?

Example Hierarchy:
GlobalPolicies/
├── HealthcareCoordination/
│   ├── PrescriptionFulfillment (base)
│   ├── SpecialistReferral (base)
│   └── Regions/
│       ├── NZ_HealthcareConsultation (localizes base)
│       └── EU_GDPR_Healthcare (adds privacy requirements)
└── HousingCoordination/
    ├── EmergencyHousing (base)
    └── SocialHousing_NZ (MSD/Kāinga Ora specific)
This could create powerful network effects where successful coordination patterns propagate globally while maintaining local adaptation capabilities.
