# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Eleutherios community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on advancing governance coordination and Prior Unity / Tino Rangatiratanga.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other community members
* **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
* **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community and governance coordination goals
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
* **Respecting diverse governance models** and cultural approaches to coordination
* **Supporting newcomers** and helping them understand the PFSD model and EleuScript

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* **Harassment or discrimination** of any kind
* **Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments**, and personal or political attacks
* **Public or private harassment**
* **Publishing others' private information**, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* **Spam or excessive self-promotion** unrelated to Eleutherios development
* **Deliberately undermining governance coordination** or sabotaging community decisions
* **Other conduct** which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Governance-Specific Guidelines

Given Eleutherios' focus on governance coordination, we also expect:

* **Respectful discussion** of governance models and political approaches
* **Good faith participation** in community decision-making processes
* **Transparent communication** about conflicts of interest or competing priorities
* **Constructive criticism** of policies and technical implementations
* **Collaborative problem-solving** rather than adversarial positioning

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

* **GitHub repositories** (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* **Communication channels** (Discord, Slack, forums)
* **Documentation** and wiki contributions
* **Community events** (virtual or in-person)
* **Official social media** accounts and communications

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
