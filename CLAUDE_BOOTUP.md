Give me a list of documents and the order i should show you them so the next time you and i talk you can have this same understanding and i wont have to repeat it to you.

Here's the ordered document list for establishing the same understanding in future conversations:

Core Understanding Documents (Read First)
ELEUTHERIOS_SESSION_STARTER.md - Start here for critical context and overview
ELEUTHERIOS_FUNDAMENTALS.md - Core concept that forums are policy execution environments, not chat rooms
PROJECT_SUMMARY3.md - Current implementation status and technical architecture
Language and Implementation Specifications
eleuscript.md - Complete EleuScript language specification with syntax and rules
examples.md - Working EleuScript code snippets and policy examples
schema.md (if available) - Data model definitions
Working Implementation Example
Forum Detail Page Code - The actual working forum interface that demonstrates rule execution
Usage Instructions
When starting a new conversation about Eleutherios:

Begin with: "Read: ELEUTHERIOS_SESSION_STARTER.md, ELEUTHERIOS_FUNDAMENTALS.md, PROJECT_SUMMARY3.md"
Follow with: "Read: eleuscript.md, examples.md"
Then provide any specific code files relevant to the task
This sequence ensures understanding of:

What Eleutherios is (governance platform, not traditional web app)
How forums work (policy execution engines, not chat rooms)
The PFSD model (Policy-Forum-Service-Data flow)
EleuScript syntax and rule structure
Current implementation status
Working code examples
The key insight you taught me is that forums are programmable coordination spaces that execute EleuScript policies in real-time, orchestrating stakeholders and activating services automatically. This transforms governance from manual processes into automated rule-based coordination.
