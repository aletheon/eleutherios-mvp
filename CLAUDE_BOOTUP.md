Usage Instructions
When starting a new conversation about Eleutherios:

Begin with: "Read: ELEUTHERIOS_SESSION_STARTER.md, ELEUTHERIOS_FUNDAMENTALS.md, PROJECT_SUMMARY_V5.md"
Follow with: "Read: eleuscript.md, examples.md"
Then provide any specific code files relevant to the task

Key Context to Establish:

What Eleutherios is: Governance platform with programmable coordination spaces
How forums work: Policy execution engines where stakeholders type EleuScript rules to trigger actions
Sub-policy creation: Stakeholders can create new policies within forums to expand coordination capabilities
Healthcare coordination: Doctor-patient-pharmacy workflows with Stripe payment integration
Rule execution framework: Natural language EleuScript parsing in forum chat input
PFSD model: Policy-Forum-Service-Data flow with real-time execution

Critical Implementation Status:

Current Priority: Implement EleuScript parser in forum chat input
Next Steps: Sub-policy creation system, healthcare coordination, Stripe integration
Testing Needs: Stripe test accounts for healthcare stakeholders

The key breakthrough is that forums are programmable governance interfaces where typing EleuScript rules immediately executes governance actions, enabling real-time coordination and dynamic policy evolution.
