# Eleutherios Fund Proposals

## Social Housing Pilot Proposal

### **Eleutherios: Automated Emergency Housing Coordination**
*Reducing homelessness response times from days to minutes through programmable governance*

#### **Problem Statement**
Emergency housing coordination currently involves manual processes across multiple agencies (MSD, Kāinga Ora, healthcare providers), creating delays that leave vulnerable people without shelter. The average time from housing request to placement is 3-7 days, during which applicants often sleep rough.

#### **Science Translation**
Eleutherios translates distributed systems research and policy automation into a deployable emergency housing coordination platform. Our EleuScript language encodes housing policies as executable rules that automatically coordinate stakeholders and trigger services.

#### **Technical Implementation**
```eleuscript
policy EmergencyHousingPolicy {
  rule ProcessApplication -> Service("EligibilityCheck",
    conditions = ["homeless_status_verified", "urgent_need_confirmed"],
    auto_approve = true
  )
  
  rule ProvideFinancialSupport -> Service("EmergencyPayment",
    amount = 200, currency = "NZD",
    trigger = "eligibility_approved"
  )
  
  rule ReserveHousing -> Service("HousingAllocation",
    trigger = "application_approved",
    stakeholders = ["KaingarOra"]
  )
}
```

#### **Pathway to Market**
- **Pilot Phase**: Deploy with Wellington Regional Housing Coalition
- **Government Adoption**: Scale to national emergency housing network
- **International Export**: License to overseas housing authorities

#### **Mātauranga Integration**
Incorporates traditional Māori concepts of manaakitanga (hospitality) and whakatōhea (collective responsibility) by ensuring no person requesting shelter is left without coordinated support. The automated system preserves human dignity while eliminating bureaucratic delays.

#### **Economic Impact**
- **Cost Reduction**: 70% reduction in coordination overhead
- **Outcome Improvement**: Target 24-hour placement vs current 3-7 days
- **System Efficiency**: Automated eligibility and payment processing

#### **Fund Criteria Alignment**
- **Leveraging Excellent Science**: Distributed systems and policy automation research
- **Translation to Market**: Clear deployment path with measurable outcomes
- **Vision Mātauranga**: Indigenous Innovation through traditional governance principles
- **Economic Growth**: Cost savings and international export potential

**Funding Request**: $100,000 over 1 year to complete pilot deployment and measure outcomes

## Healthcare Access Pilot Proposal

### **Eleutherios: Automated Healthcare Enrollment and Coordination**
*Eliminating barriers to healthcare access through intelligent service coordination*

#### **Problem Statement**
Healthcare access for vulnerable populations involves navigating multiple disconnected systems (GP enrollment, specialist referrals, mental health services, pharmaceutical access). Complex eligibility requirements and manual coordination create barriers that delay or prevent care.

#### **Science Translation**
Applies policy automation research to healthcare coordination, creating a platform where patient needs trigger automatic service activation across providers. Reduces manual case management while ensuring comprehensive care coordination.

#### **Technical Implementation**
```eleuscript
policy HealthcareAccessPolicy {
  rule EnrollWithGP -> Service("HealthcareEnrollment",
    trigger = "patient_request",
    auto_execute = true
  )
  
  rule ScheduleAppointments -> Service("AppointmentBooking",
    services = ["GP", "dental", "mental_health"],
    based_on = "patient_needs_assessment"
  )
  
  rule CoordinateCare -> Forum("Care Coordination",
    stakeholders = ["Patient", "GP", "SocialWorker"],
    trigger = "multiple_services_required"
  )
}
```

#### **Pathway to Market**
- **Pilot Phase**: Partner with Community Health Centers and iwi health providers
- **DHB Integration**: Scale to District Health Board systems
- **International Licensing**: Export to healthcare systems globally

#### **Mātauranga Integration**
Embodies hauora (wellbeing) as holistic health by automatically coordinating not just medical care but social services, housing support, and cultural connections. Ensures Māori health providers are included in care coordination for Māori patients.

#### **Economic Impact**
- **Access Improvement**: Reduce time-to-first-appointment from weeks to days
- **Cost Efficiency**: Eliminate duplicate assessments and referral delays
- **Health Outcomes**: Earlier intervention through automated screening and referral

#### **Taiao Alignment**
Supports environmental health by coordinating services locally, reducing travel requirements and connecting patients with community-based care options that strengthen local health ecosystems.

#### **Fund Criteria Alignment**
- **Leveraging Excellent Science**: Healthcare informatics and coordination research
- **Translation to Market**: Immediate deployment opportunity with health providers
- **Vision Mātauranga**: Hauora and Indigenous Innovation integration
- **Economic Growth**: Healthcare efficiency gains and technology export

**Funding Request**: $100,000 over 1 year to develop healthcare-specific modules and pilot with selected health providers

## Combined Value Proposition

Both proposals demonstrate how Eleutherios creates new technology infrastructure that:
- **Translates existing governance research** into market-ready solutions
- **Addresses urgent social problems** with measurable impact
- **Incorporates Indigenous innovation** in systemic coordination
- **Creates export opportunities** for New Zealand technology leadership
- **Generates economic growth** through efficiency gains and new industry creation

The social housing and healthcare pilots would establish Eleutherios as the global leader in automated governance coordination, positioning New Zealand at the forefront of the emerging programmable governance industry.
