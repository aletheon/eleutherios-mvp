# Eleutherios UX Design Briefs

This folder contains UX design briefs for the four core layers of the Eleutherios architecture:

1. **Policy** – rules / principles  
2. **Forum** – discussion & instantiation  
3. **Service** – execution & delivery  
4. **Data** – knowledge & evidence  

Each brief provides purpose, key components, user flow, backend considerations, and future extensions.  
These are intended for developers, designers, and stakeholders working on the Eleutherios MVP.
