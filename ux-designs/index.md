## Notes
- Screens are designed to be **policy-aware** (rules auto-generate forums, services consume policies).  
- Services may be **free or paid** (Stripe or other payment providers).  
- Forum participants, service owners, and policymakers are all treated as **stakeholders/services**.  
- All assets and screenshots are stored under `/images`.
