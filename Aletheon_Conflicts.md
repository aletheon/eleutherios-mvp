# CONFLICTS & RELATED‑PARTY TRANSACTIONS POLICY — Aletheon Foundation (Template)

__

Prepared: 2025-10-08 — Template, not legal advice.

## Principle

Trustees must act solely in the Foundation’s best interests. Conflicts of interest must be disclosed, recorded, and managed transparently.

## Disclosure

Maintain an interests register; declare conflicts at the start of each meeting where relevant business is conducted.

## Recusal

A conflicted Trustee must not be counted in quorum for the conflicted decision and must not vote on the matter. Minutes must record the disclosure and recusal.

## Related‑party transactions

Transactions with related parties (including Eleutherios Limited) must be arm’s‑length, fair, and consistent with the Foundation’s charitable purposes. Independent trustees must approve such transactions.

## Documentation

Maintain written contracts, comparables where available, and clear justifications to evidence fair value. Publish a summary in annual reporting where appropriate.

## Review

This policy shall be reviewed annually by the Board or upon material changes in law or operations.
