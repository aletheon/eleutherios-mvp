# Eleutherios MVP - Project Summary

## Overview
Eleutherios is a governance platform implementing the Policy-Forum-Service-Data (PFSD) model. It provides a shared operating system for stakeholders to create policies, offer services, participate in forums, and build trust through the CERT scoring system.

### Routing Structure
```
/users                  # User directory ‚úÖ
/users/[id]            # User detail pages ‚úÖ
/policies/[policyId]   # Policy detail pages ‚úÖ
/forums/[forumId]      # Forum detail pages (coordination forum ‚úÖ)
/services/[serviceId]  # Service detail pages ‚úÖ
/login                 # Authentication ‚úÖ
/register              # User registration ‚úÖ
```

## Development Strategy

### Current Phase: Real User-Generated Content (Path B)
**Goal**: Transition from mock data prototype to functional platform with real user accounts and content creation

**Learning Approach**: Building user workflows by experiencing the system from each user role's perspective - understanding how a caseworker creates policies, how a person registers for services, how providers offer assistance.

### Phase 1: Authentication Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Real Firebase user accounts with role-based access control
- User registration and profile management
- Protected routes and navigation integration

### Phase 2: User-Generated Content (Current Focus)
**Next Implementation Priority**:
1. **Update User Directory** - Replace mock users with real Firebase users
2. **Policy Creation Interface** - Enable authenticated users to create and manage policies
3. **Service Registration** - Allow users to register services they provide
4. **Dynamic CERT Scoring** - Calculate scores from actual user interactions
5. **Connect Real Content** - Link policies, services, and forums to actual user accounts

## Key Design Principles

### Visual Language
- **Color-coded Metrics** - Users learn to associate colors with data types
- **Circular Indicators** - Compact, scannable metric display
- **Consistent Typography** - Clear hierarchy and readability

### User Experience
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality works, enhanced features add value
- **Contextual Navigation** - Easy movement between related content
- **Information Density** - Rich data presentation without clutter

## Key Breakthrough: Policy ‚Üí Forum ‚Üí Service Cycle Demonstrated

**Critical Implementation**: The forum at `/forums/coordination` provides the first complete demonstration of Eleutherios' core value proposition - **EleuScript policies that create live coordination spaces where services are activated through stakeholder collaboration**.

### **How It Works**:
1. **Policy Rules** (written in EleuScript) define that emergency situations should create coordination forums
2. **Forums become real-time coordination spaces** where multiple stakeholders (person, MSD caseworker, housing officer, healthcare provider) collaborate 
3. **Services get activated through forum conversations** (housing grants approved, healthcare enrollment completed, food assistance provided)
4. **Full audit trail** ensures compliance and trust through transparent decision-making

This demonstrates the **theoretical becoming practical** - governance policies automatically creating the infrastructure needed for stakeholders to coordinate and deliver services.

### **Future Healthcare Applications**:
Doctors could use EleuScript to define treatment protocols as code:
```eleuscript
policy DiabetesManagement {
  rule InitialAssessment -> Forum("Patient Intake", 
    required_data = ["HbA1c", "BMI", "medical_history"]
  )
  
  rule TreatmentPlan -> Service("PersonalizedTreatment", 
    conditions = ["HbA1c > 7.0"],
    medications = ["metformin_500mg"],
    monitoring = ["monthly_checkup"]
  )
}
```

This would enable **real-time medical decision support**, automated **insulin adjustments**, **medication threshold monitoring**, and **treatment escalations** based on live patient data.
