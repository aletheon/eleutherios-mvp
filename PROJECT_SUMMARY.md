# Eleutherios MVP - Project Summary

## Overview
Eleutherios is a governance platform implementing the Policy-Forum-Service-Data (PFSD) model. It provides a shared operating system for stakeholders to create policies, offer services, participate in forums, and build trust through the CERT scoring system.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Features

#### User Management & Profiles
- **User Directory** (`/users`) - Browse network participants with search and filtering
- **User Detail Pages** (`/users/[id]`) - Comprehensive user profiles showing:
  - CERT score breakdown (Cooperation, Engagement, Retention, Trust)
  - Public contributions (policies, services, forums)
  - Connection metrics with color-coded circular indicators
  - Bio, location, and contact information

#### Policy System
- **Policy Detail Pages** (`/policies/[policyId]`) - Individual policy views with:
  - Policy metadata (stakeholders, status, creation date)
  - Author information with profile links
  - Full policy content display
  - Action buttons (Follow, Share, Export)

#### CERT Scoring System
- **Visual CERT Breakdown** - Interactive charts showing:
  - Cooperation: How often users collaborate
  - Engagement: Responsiveness and interaction quality  
  - Retention: User loyalty and repeat interactions
  - Trust: Community endorsements and reputation
- **Color-coded Metrics** - Consistent visual language:
  - Blue circles: Connections
  - Yellow circles: Reviews/Ratings
  - Green circles: Response time
  - Purple circles: Success/Completion rate

#### Navigation & UI
- **Dashboard Layout** - Consistent navigation across all pages
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile
- **Authentication Integration** - User context throughout the app

### 🚧 Partially Implemented

#### Forum System
- **Forum Detail Pages** (`/forums/[forumId]`) - Route structure exists
- **Forum Links** - Navigation from user profiles works
- **Content** - Forum detail page implementation needed

### ⏳ Planned Features

#### Service System
- **Service Detail Pages** (`/services/[serviceId]`) - Route structure exists
- **Service Management** - Creation and management interface needed
- **Service Links** - Currently non-clickable pending implementation

#### EleuScript Integration
- **Policy Creation** - DSL-based policy authoring
- **Rule Engine** - Policy rule execution and validation
- **Service Consumption** - Policy-to-service binding

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 13+** - App Router with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **React Hooks** - State management (useState, useEffect, useCallback)

### Data Structure
- **Mock Data Implementation** - JSON-based user and policy data
- **Type Safety** - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- **Modular Components** - Reusable UI components

### Routing Structure
```
/users                  # User directory
/users/[id]            # User detail pages
/policies/[policyId]   # Policy detail pages  
/forums/[forumId]      # Forum detail pages (structure ready)
/services/[serviceId]  # Service detail pages (structure ready)
```

## Key Design Principles

### Visual Language
- **Color-coded Metrics** - Users learn to associate colors with data types
- **Circular Indicators** - Compact, scannable metric display
- **Consistent Typography** - Clear hierarchy and readability

### User Experience
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality works, enhanced features add value
- **Contextual Navigation** - Easy movement between related content
- **Information Density** - Rich data presentation without clutter

## Next Development Priorities

1. **Service Detail Pages** - Complete the service management workflow
2. **Forum Implementation** - Build forum detail and interaction features  
3. **Policy Creation UI** - EleuScript editor and policy authoring tools
4. **Real API Integration** - Replace mock data with backend services
5. **Advanced CERT Analytics** - Historical trends and peer comparisons

## Mission Alignment
This MVP demonstrates the core Eleutherios vision: enabling governance through transparent policies, measurable trust (CERT scores), and connected stakeholder networks. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for the full PFSD model while maintaining focus on user experience and data-driven decision making.
