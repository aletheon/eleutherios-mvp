# Eleutherios Session Starter - EleuScript Payments MVP (October 2025)

## CURRENT FOCUS: EleuScript Payment Rules with Stripe Connect

**Primary Objective**: Build working MVP where users can type payment rules in chat that execute real Stripe transactions.

**Target Rule Syntax**:
```eleuscript
rule paySeller -> Service("StripePayment", { payerId: user.userId, payeeId: seller.userId, amount: $5.00 })
```

## Current Status & Constraints

### Company Status ‚úÖ READY
- **Legal Entity**: Eleutherios, Inc. (Delaware C-Corporation) 
- **Stripe Account**: Incorporation completed, EIN expected Oct 23-Nov 6
- **Banking**: Will open business account after EIN arrives
- **Stripe Connect**: Can enable after banking setup

### Technical Status üîß IN PROGRESS
- **Codebase**: Next.js app with working structure
- **EleuScript Parser**: Basic implementation, needs TypeScript fixes
- **Stripe Integration**: Test mode ready, Connect pending EIN
- **Current Issues**: TypeScript compilation errors (see fixes below)

### Revenue Model (Immediate)
- **Platform fees**: 3-5% of transactions processed through EleuScript
- **No subscription complexity**: Simple usage-based pricing
- **Target customers**: Small businesses, freelancers, service providers

## What We're Building (Next 5 Days)

### Day 1-2: Fix Foundation
**Priority**: Get EleuScript parser working without errors
- Fix TypeScript export/import issues
- Test payment rule parsing with various syntaxes
- Create simple test suite for parser logic

### Day 3-4: Payment Flow (Test Mode)
**Priority**: Build complete payment flow using Stripe test mode
- Mock Stripe Connect accounts for testing
- Payment intent creation from EleuScript rules
- Basic error handling and validation

### Day 5: User Experience
**Priority**: Polish the chat interface for payment rules
- Real-time rule detection in chat
- Payment confirmations and status updates
- Simple onboarding flow for new users

## Technical Architecture (Simplified)

### Core Components
1. **EleuScript Parser** - Detects and parses payment rules from chat
2. **Payment Executor** - Creates Stripe payment intents from parsed rules
3. **Chat Interface** - Real-time rule execution in conversation
4. **User Management** - Connect accounts and payment authorization

### File Structure (Current)

        execute.ts         ‚Üê Rule execution endpoint
  components/
    EleuScriptChat.tsx     ‚Üê Chat interface with payments
```

## Immediate Technical Fixes Needed

### 1. TypeScript Export Issues
Replace your current `types/eleuscript.ts` with the fixed version that properly exports PaymentRule interface.

### 2. Parser Implementation
Your parser needs to handle user field references like `user.userId` and actual values like `$5.00`.

### 3. Chat Integration
The existing chat component needs payment rule detection and execution.

## Post-EIN Roadmap (After Oct 23)

### Week 1: Stripe Connect Setup
- Open business bank account
- Enable Stripe Connect in dashboard
- Create Express accounts for test users
- Switch from test mode to live payments

### Week 2: User Onboarding
- Stripe Connect account creation flow
- Payment authorization and verification
- Basic user dashboard for transaction history

### Week 3: Polish & Deploy
- Error handling improvements
- Payment confirmation UI
- Production deployment
- First real customer testing

## Success Metrics (30 Days)

**Technical Milestones**:
- EleuScript parser handles 95% of payment rule variations
- Payment flow works end-to-end in test mode
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors

**Business Milestones**:
- 10+ test users successfully complete payment flows
- Payment processing time under 3 seconds
- Clear documentation for rule syntax

**Revenue Validation**:
- First real money transaction through EleuScript
- Platform fee collection working
- Customer feedback on payment experience

## Current Limitations & Scope

### What We're NOT Building
- Complex coordination workflows (forums, policies)
- Multi-party payment splits (yet)
- Government or healthcare integrations
- Advanced EleuScript features (loops, conditionals)

### What We ARE Building
- Simple peer-to-peer payments through chat
- Natural language payment commands
- Basic user account management
- Stripe Connect integration

## Key Resources

### Documentation Priorities
1. EleuScript payment rule syntax guide
2. Stripe Connect onboarding process
3. Payment flow error handling
4. Customer support for payment issues

### Technical Debt
- TypeScript configuration needs cleanup
- Error handling is minimal
- No automated testing yet
- Payment security validation needed

**REMEMBER**: This is an MVP focused specifically on payment rules. The broader Eleutherios platform vision (government coordination, healthcare workflows, etc.) comes later. Right now we're proving that natural language payment commands can work and generate revenue.
