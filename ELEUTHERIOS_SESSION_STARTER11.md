## CRITICAL: Read ELEUTHERIOS_FUNDAMENTALS.md First
Before doing anything, you must understand that **forums are programmable governance and marketplace environments** that can evolve capabilities in real-time through EleuScript policy execution.

## Current Status: Active Fundraising + Incorporation In Progress

### Company Incorporation Status ✅ IN PROGRESS
- **Reserved Name**: ELEUTHERIOS LIMITED (Reserve ID: 15384349)
- **Status**: Name reservation paid ($10 NZD), awaiting approval email
- **Next Step**: Complete full incorporation once name approved (~$150 more)
- **Timeline**: 1-2 business days for approval, then 1-2 days for incorporation
- **Purpose**: Removes investor red flag, creates legal entity for SAFE investments

### Active Fundraising Round
- **Round Type**: Pre-seed/Angel 
- **Target Amount**: $100K-$250K NZD
- **Current Runway**: $10K NZD (3-6 months depending on burn rate)
- **Investment Structure**: SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)
- **Dilution Target**: Maintain 80%+ founder ownership
- **Status**: OpenVC application submitted, pitch materials deployed

### OpenVC Application Details
- **Stage**: Demonstrator/Prototype/MVP
- **Business Model**: Marketplace (20% platform fees, 80% to providers)
- **SAM**: $10B-$100B (healthcare + government + professional services coordination)
- **Primary Market**: New Zealand (next 12 months)
- **Expansion Markets**: Australia, Canada, UK (next 18 months)
- **Team**: Solo founder (technical + business development)
- **Round Security**: Under 20% secured (normal for early stage)

### Value Proposition (95 characters for investor platforms)
**"We build a platform to help multi-stakeholder teams turn conversations into complete workflows"**

## URGENT PRIORITIES (Given Limited Runway)

### 1. Complete Company Incorporation (This Week)
- **Wait for email approval** of ELEUTHERIOS LIMITED name reservation
- **Complete full incorporation** once approved (~$150 NZD)
- **Update OpenVC profile** to remove red flag
- **Open business bank account** for investment receipt

### 2. Partnership Revenue Validation (Immediate)
With only $10K runway, proving revenue model is critical:
- **Healthcare pilots**: Can GP clinics pay $15 platform fee per $75 consultation?
- **Government consulting**: Can you charge MSD/Kāinga Ora for coordination consulting?
- **Professional services**: Can consulting firms pay for specialist coordination workflows?

### 3. Investor Pipeline Development
- **OpenVC follow-ups**: Respond to any investor interest quickly
- **Angel network outreach**: Leverage working demos for local NZ angel investors
- **Partnership LOIs**: Get letters of intent from healthcare/government partners to strengthen investor case

## Technical Foundation: Sub-Policy Creation OPERATIONAL ✅

### Confirmed Working on Production
**Production URLs:**
- Main app: `https://eleutherios-mvp.vercel.app`
- **Professional pitch**: `/pitch` (investor/partner ready)
- Healthcare demo: `/demo/healthcare` (5-step coordination workflow)
- Housing demo: `/demo/housing` (5-step government coordination)
- Test interface: `/test-sub-policy` (EleuScript execution testing)

### Core Breakthrough Proven
**Forums can evolve capabilities in real-time** through natural language rules:
```eleuscript
rule AddHealthcare -> Policy("HealthcareAccess", stakeholders=["Patient", "Doctor"])
rule ActivateTransport -> Service("Transportation", conditions=["urgent_need"])
rule ProvideSupport -> Service("EmergencyPayment", amount=200, currency="NZD")
```

### Working Features
- **Real-time EleuScript detection** - Purple highlighting when typing rules
- **Sub-policy creation** - Dynamic forum capability expansion
- **Audit trail system** - Complete governance event logging
- **Multi-stakeholder coordination** - Healthcare and housing workflows proven
- **Payment integration design** - Ready for Stripe multi-party processing

## Market Validation: Two Proven Domains

### Healthcare Coordination ($75 Revenue Model)
- **Workflow**: Doctor + Patient → "add pharmacy" → Pharmacist joins → Prescription coordination
- **Revenue split**: 80% doctor, 20% platform ($60 + $15)
- **Market size**: $4.5T global healthcare, ~3,000 GPs in NZ
- **Partnership opportunity**: GP clinics for prescription coordination pilots

### Government Coordination ($2,600 Support Services)
- **Workflow**: MSD + Applicant → "add kāinga_ora" → Housing Officer joins → Multi-agency support
- **Value creation**: Reduced admin overhead, faster service delivery
- **Compliance**: Privacy Act, Social Security Act audit trails built-in
- **Partnership opportunity**: Direct MSD/Kāinga Ora integration pilots

### Cross-Domain Pattern Proven
Same coordination mechanism works across healthcare, government, and professional services - this breadth is the competitive advantage.

## Immediate Revenue Opportunities (Critical for Runway)

### 1. Coordination Consulting Services
While building the platform, offer manual coordination consulting:
- **Healthcare**: Help GP clinics coordinate with pharmacies/specialists
- **Government**: Consult on MSD-Kāinga Ora workflow improvements  
- **Professional services**: Manual multi-stakeholder project coordination
- **Rate**: $150-300 NZD per day consulting, immediate revenue

### 2. Partnership Pilots with Revenue
- **Healthcare**: Charge $50-100 setup fee + $15 per coordination
- **Government**: Fixed consulting fee for pilot coordination improvement
- **Professional services**: Project-based coordination setup fees

### 3. Demo-to-Revenue Pipeline
Use working demos to sell immediate coordination consulting while building toward full platform automation.

## Technical Development Priorities (Secondary to Revenue)

### 1. Autonomous Service Validation Engine
Transform services from passive listings to decision-making entities:
```eleuscript
# Customer request
rule pay -> Service("LocalMilk", $1)

# Autonomous service response
"Sorry, you're outside our delivery area (15.2km away, max 10km)"
```

### 2. Real Payment Integration
- **Stripe multi-party processing** for healthcare consultations
- **Government payment workflows** for support services
- **Professional service billing** integration

### 3. Mobile Optimization
Ensure coordination workflows work smoothly on mobile devices for real-world usage.

## Fundraising Strategy

### Investor Value Proposition
- **Working demos**: Healthcare ($75) + Housing ($2,600) coordination with real transactions
- **Government opportunity**: Clear efficiency value for public sector
- **Cross-domain pattern**: Same coordination works across multiple industries
- **First-mover advantage**: Natural language coordination is genuinely novel
- **Revenue validation**: Path to immediate revenue through partnerships

### Partnership Leverage for Investors
- **Healthcare LOIs**: Letters of intent from GP clinics strengthen investment case
- **Government interest**: MSD/Kāinga Ora pilot discussions show institutional validation
- **Professional services**: Consulting firm coordination needs demonstrate broad market

### Next Round Strategy (12-18 months)
- **Seed round**: $500K-$1M after proving revenue model with paying customers
- **Expansion focus**: Australia, Canada, UK with similar multi-stakeholder coordination needs
- **Product-market fit proof**: Regular revenue from healthcare, government, professional services

## Key Risks and Mitigation

### 1. Runway Risk (Critical)
- **Problem**: Only $10K, 3-6 months runway
- **Mitigation**: Immediate revenue through coordination consulting while fundraising
- **Backup plan**: Part-time approach with contract work to extend runway

### 2. Incorporation Delay Risk
- **Problem**: Investment can't proceed without proper company structure
- **Mitigation**: Complete incorporation within 1-2 weeks, track email approvals closely
- **Timeline**: Should be resolved before end of October 2025

### 3. Partnership Validation Risk
- **Problem**: Demos don't guarantee paying customers
- **Mitigation**: Convert demos to paid consulting relationships quickly
- **Validation approach**: Charge for coordination even if manual initially
