### Core Breakthrough Proven
**Forums can evolve capabilities in real-time** through natural language rules:
```eleuscript
rule AddHousingSupport -> Policy("HousingAssistance", stakeholders=["Applicant", "MSD", "KaingaOra"])
rule ActivateBondAssistance -> Service("BondPayment", amount=2400, currency="NZD")
rule CreateMultiAgency -> Forum("IntegratedSupport", stakeholders=["MSD", "Health", "Housing"])
```

### Working Features
- **Real-time EleuScript detection** - Purple highlighting when typing rules
- **Sub-policy creation** - Dynamic forum capability expansion
- **Government audit trail system** - Complete compliance event logging
- **Multi-agency coordination** - MSD-Kāinga Ora workflows proven
- **Payment integration design** - Ready for government payment processing

## Market Validation: GovTech Primary, Healthcare Secondary

### **Primary: Government Coordination (High-Value Contracts)**
- **Workflow**: MSD + Applicant → "add kāinga_ora" → Housing Officer joins → Multi-agency support
- **Value creation**: $100-300 per coordination in time/efficiency savings
- **Revenue model**: $25-50 per coordination, $25K-100K annual contracts
- **Market size**: 32 NZ ministries/departments, 78 councils, 100+ crown entities
- **Partnership opportunity**: Direct MSD/Kāinga Ora integration pilots

### **Secondary: Healthcare Coordination (Volume Model)**
- **Workflow**: Doctor + Patient → "add pharmacy" → Pharmacist joins → Prescription coordination
- **Value creation**: $50-100 per coordination in time savings
- **Revenue model**: $10 per coordination (10% + $2.50 flat fee on $75 consultations)
- **Market size**: ~3,000 GPs in NZ
- **Partnership opportunity**: GP clinics for prescription coordination pilots

### **Cross-Domain Pattern Proven**
Same coordination mechanism works across government, healthcare, and professional services - this breadth is the competitive advantage with GovTech as the beachhead market.

## Revenue Model: Value-Based Coordination Pricing

### **What is "One Coordination"?**
**A coordination = One complete multi-stakeholder workflow from initiation to resolution.**

**Government Example**: MSD case worker types `rule add kāinga_ora → Policy('HousingSupport')` → Housing officer joins → Multi-agency support plan created → Bond assistance ($2,400) activated → Complete audit trail logged = **1 coordination worth $25-50**

### **Pricing Strategy: Charge for Value, Not Costs**
- **Actual cost per coordination**: $0.35-0.75 (database, compute, compliance)
- **Value created per coordination**: $100-300 (time saved, efficiency gained, better outcomes)
- **Fee charged**: $10-50 (3-15% of value created)
- **Customer ROI**: 5:1 to 20:1 value-to-price ratio drives adoption

### **Tiered Pricing by Market**

**GovTech (Primary Revenue Stream):**
- **Inter-agency coordination**: $25-50 per complete workflow

- **Multi-agency contracts**: $100,000-500,000/year cross-department access

**Healthcare (Secondary Revenue):**
- **Doctor-pharmacy coordination**: $10 per workflow
- **Monthly subscriptions**: $150/month + $3 per coordination
- **Annual contracts**: $1,500/year + $2 per coordination

**Professional Services (Tertiary):**
- **Multi-specialist coordination**: $50-100 per complex workflow
- **Enterprise consulting**: Custom pricing for large firms
