__

Prepared: 2025-10-08 — Template, not legal advice.

## Parties & Term

Licensor: Aletheon Foundation (Charitable Trust). Licensee: Eleutherios Limited (NZ Company). Term: 3 years, auto‑renewing annually unless terminated under clause 12.

## Definitions

“Core IP” = PFSD specification, EleuScript language, reference libraries, and documentation published by the Foundation. “Trademarks” = the marks listed in Schedule A. “Licensed Products/Services” = Company offerings implementing or interoperating with Core IP.

## IP Grant

Non‑exclusive, worldwide licence to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute Core IP solely to develop and provide Licensed Products/Services, subject to Apache‑2.0; this Agreement adds no further restrictions; in any conflict, Apache‑2.0 prevails.

## Patent Non‑aggression

The Company will not assert patents necessarily infringed by its contributed improvements against the Foundation or users of the open‑core.

## Trademark Licence

Non‑exclusive, revocable right to use the Trademarks solely to describe compatibility or community participation, per the Trademark Policy (Schedule B). No co‑branding or implied endorsement without prior written consent. Foundation may require quality‑control samples.

## Consideration

Arms‑length consideration to reflect fair value, structured as one or more of: (a) annual sponsorship; (b) services vouchers for community work; and/or (c) royalty of x% of net licence/hosting revenue (if applicable). Consideration must not create private benefit inconsistent with charitable purposes.

## Contributions Upstream

The Company will propose generic fixes/features via PRs and RFCs. Customer‑specific or confidential work is excluded; where feasible, contribute interfaces to enable interoperability.

## Reporting & Compliance

Semi‑annual report: usage summary, contributions, security issues disclosed, and sponsorship paid. Follow the open‑source security policy and promptly disclose material vulnerabilities.

## Confidentiality

Mutual protection for non‑public information exchanged under this Agreement.

## Data & Ethics

Privacy‑by‑design and, in Aotearoa, alignment with Māori data sovereignty principles (e.g., Te Mana Raraunga).

## Warranties & Liability

Core IP is provided “as is”. No indirect/consequential liability. Liability cap: fees paid in the 12 months prior to the claim (insert alternative if required).

## Suspension & Termination

Foundation may suspend trademark use immediately for quality/brand misuse. Either party may terminate for uncured material breach with 30 days’ notice. On termination, trademark use ceases; open‑source rights survive under Apache‑2.0.

## Publicity

Press or public announcements referencing the Foundation require prior written approval.

## Governing Law

New Zealand law; mediation prior to litigation is recommended.

## Schedule A — Trademarks

PFSD, EleuScript, Aletheon 〈add classes/jurisdictions〉

## Schedule B — Trademark Policy (Summary)

Use marks only to describe compatibility or accurate affiliation; follow visual guidelines; no modification; no domain/company/app names using the marks without consent; audit rights; cease on request if non‑compliant.
