# Grant Proposal: Policy-Forum-Service-Data (PFSD) Protocol
## Improving Inter-Agency Coordination for Emergency Housing

### Executive Summary

**Project Title**: PFSD Protocol Pilot - Emergency Housing Coordination System

**Applicant**: Rob Kara, Aletheon Foundation  
**Contact**: rob.kara@gmail.com

**Funding Requested**: $80,000 NZD  
**Project Duration**: 12 months  
**Project Type**: Social innovation pilot / Technology development

**Problem**: People experiencing homelessness must navigate multiple disconnected government agencies (MSD, Kāinga Ora, DHB), filling out duplicate forms and waiting weeks for coordination between services. This fragmentation causes delays in housing placement and increases administrative burden.

**Solution**: The PFSD Protocol creates shared policy frameworks that enable real-time coordination between agencies, reducing bureaucratic duplication and accelerating service delivery from weeks to days.

**Expected Outcome**: Demonstrate 50% reduction in time-to-housing for 20 pilot participants through improved inter-agency coordination.

### 1. Problem Statement

**Current System Failures:**

When someone experiences homelessness in New Zealand, they must:
- Contact MSD separately for financial support (forms, interview, assessment, waiting list)
- Contact Kāinga Ora separately for housing placement (separate forms, separate assessment, separate waiting)
- Navigate healthcare enrollment through DHB (another separate process)

Each agency operates independently with:
- Separate intake processes requiring duplicate information
- No shared visibility into other agencies' actions
- Manual coordination via email/phone when agencies do communicate
- No transparency for the person about where they are in the process

**Quantifiable Impact:**
- Average time from homelessness to housing placement: 4-8 weeks
- Administrative cost per case: estimated $2,000+ in duplicated effort
- People fall through gaps between agencies due to poor coordination

**Human Cost:**
- Additional weeks of rough sleeping or unstable accommodation
- Stress and confusion from navigating multiple bureaucracies
- Health deterioration while waiting for coordination

This is fundamentally a **coordination failure** that technology can address.

### 2. Proposed Solution: PFSD Protocol

**Core Innovation:**

Instead of each agency maintaining separate policies and processes, the PFSD Protocol creates **shared policy frameworks** that multiple agencies consume together.

**How It Works:**

1. **Policy**: A shared "Emergency Housing Framework" is created once, containing all rules (eligibility, financial support, housing placement, healthcare enrollment)

2. **Forum**: When someone requests emergency housing, a coordination forum is automatically created containing ALL relevant stakeholders (person, MSD caseworker, KO housing officer, healthcare provider)

3. **Service**: Each agency provides services through the shared forum, with real-time visibility of all actions

4. **Data**: All communications, approvals, and status updates are logged in one shared space, providing transparency and accountability

**Key Benefits:**
- Person fills out information once (not 3+ times)
- All agencies coordinate in real-time (not via email chains)
- Person sees exactly where they are in the process
- Time to housing reduced from weeks to days
- Administrative costs reduced through elimination of duplication

### 3. Technical Approach

**Proof of Concept (Already Built):**
- Working demonstration available at: eleutherios-mvp.vercel.app
- GitHub repository: github.com/aletheon/eleutherios-mvp
- Demonstrates onboarding flow and multi-stakeholder coordination

**Pilot Development (12 months):**
- Month 1-2: Requirements gathering with MSD, Kāinga Ora, DHB stakeholders
- Month 3-5: Production system development with security, authentication, data protection
- Month 6-7: Agency training and integration
- Month 8-12: Pilot with 20 participants, evaluation, iteration

**Technology Stack:**
- Next.js (web application)
- Firebase (secure data storage)
- Mobile-responsive design (accessible on phones at libraries, shelters)
- Privacy-first architecture (GDPR compliant)

---

### 4. Pilot Program Design

**Participants**: 20 people experiencing homelessness in Christchurch

**Partner Agencies** (to be confirmed):
- Ministry of Social Development (Christchurch office)
- Kāinga Ora (Christchurch)
- Canterbury DHB or community healthcare provider
- One local homeless shelter/support service

**Pilot Protocol:**
1. Person experiencing homelessness creates service request through PFSD system
2. System automatically creates coordination forum with relevant agencies
3. MSD caseworker assesses eligibility and approves financial support
4. KO housing officer identifies available placement
5. Healthcare provider enrolls person in services
6. All coordination happens in shared forum with full transparency

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Time from initial request to housing placement
- Number of forms/interactions required
- Participant satisfaction (survey)
- Agency staff feedback (survey)
- Administrative cost per case
- Comparison to control group using traditional process

---

### 7. Risks and Mitigation

**Risk: Agency participation**
- *Mitigation*: Secure written commitment from partner agencies before pilot begins
- *Backup plan*: Start with smaller scope (e.g., just MSD + KO, without healthcare)

**Risk: Participant recruitment**
- *Mitigation*: Partner with existing homeless services who can refer participants
- *Backup plan*: Extend recruitment period, reduce pilot size to 15 participants

**Risk: Technical barriers (participants lack phones/internet)**
- *Mitigation*: Provide access via shelter computers, library computers, or case worker assistance
- *Backup plan*: Case workers can input information on behalf of participants

**Risk: Privacy/data security concerns**
- *Mitigation*: Privacy-by-design approach, data minimization, security audit before launch
- *Backup plan*: Implement additional security measures, use pseudonymization

**Risk: System complexity (too hard to use)**
- *Mitigation*: Extensive user testing, simple mobile-first design, training for all users
- *Backup plan*: Simplify features, provide more hands-on support during pilot

### 8. Sustainability Plan

**After Pilot Success:**

**Year 2**: Expand to 200 participants across multiple regions
- Funding source: Government contract based on proven cost savings

**Year 3+**: Scale nationally
- Revenue model: Government pays per-user or per-case fee
- Cost recovery through demonstrated administrative savings

**Long-term Vision**:
