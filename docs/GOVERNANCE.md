# Governance Guidelines

This document outlines how decisions are made and responsibilities are shared in the Eleutherios open-source project.

---

## 1. Purpose

Eleutherios is an open-source initiative guided by the principle of **Prior Unity**. Governance reflects this by emphasizing transparency, inclusion, and collective responsibility. The repository is hosted under the guardianship of the **Aletheon Foundation**.

---

## 2. Roles

- **Maintainers**  
  Responsible for reviewing pull requests, merging contributions, and ensuring overall code quality.  
  Maintainers are stewards, not owners. They act in service to the collective.

- **Contributors**  
  Anyone who submits code, documentation, or ideas via issues, pull requests, or discussions.  
  Contributors may become maintainers by consistent and meaningful participation.

- **Users / Stakeholders**  
  Anyone who benefits from Eleutherios or uses it to build policies, forums, services, or data integrations.

---

## 3. Decision-Making

- **Consensus First**: Decisions are made openly in GitHub discussions or issues. Agreement from multiple maintainers is sought.  
- **Voting**: If consensus cannot be reached, maintainers may call for a simple majority vote.  
- **Vetoes**: A veto must include clear reasoning and an alternative proposal.

---

## 4. Transparency

- All discussions and decisions must be documented in issues or pull requests.  
- No private decision-making. Eleutherios governance is open by design.

---

## 5. Code of Conduct

- Respect all participants.  
- Listen with empathy.  
- Critique ideas, not people.  
- Act in alignment with the principle: **Governance through Love in Action**.

---

## 6. Evolution

This governance file itself is a **policy**.  
It may be updated by pull request and requires approval by at least **2 maintainers** or **1 maintainer + 3 contributors**.
