# Eleutherios Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phased development of Eleutherios — from MVP through to IAAS/OS and custom hardware.

---

## Phase 1: MVP (0–6 Months)
**Goal:** Deliver a functional prototype to demonstrate the Policy–Forum–Service–Data cycle for social housing.

- **Backend:** Firebase Firestore with Cloud Functions for rule→forum/service materialization
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js demo (basic UI for creating/viewing policies, rules, services)
- **Use Case:** Māori Social Housing (seeded with healthcare, housing, food, identity policies)
- **Team:** 1 contract developer + founder guidance
- **Funding:** ~$10K NZD available, supplemented by Capability Fund application
- **Output:** Demo app + seed data + presentation materials for stakeholders

---

## Phase 2: Scaling & Ecosystem (6–24 Months)
**Goal:** Establish Eleutherios as a working governance platform.

- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Expand Firebase to hybrid Postgres + Cloud Functions
- **Features:** Authentication, role-based access, policy editing, multi-forum services
- **Community:** Outreach to Māori housing orgs, digital inclusion groups
- **Partnerships:** Research org collaborations (Ara Whaihua, Rangapū Rangahau)
- **Governance:** Aletheon Foundation formally established with trustees/board
- **Funding Target:** $3.57M runway for 3 years
- **Output:** Production-ready SaaS layer + growing partner ecosystem

---

## Phase 3: IAAS + Operating System (24–48 Months)
**Goal:** Transition Eleutherios from SaaS/PaaS into its own infrastructure + OS.

- **IAAS:** Develop decentralized compute/storage primitives (open standard protocols)
- **OS Layer:** “Governance Kernel” handling Policy–Forum–Service–Data as system calls
- **Developer Tools:** SDK for building services on Eleutherios OS
- **Research:** Explore distributed consensus, on-chain governance, trustless coordination
- **Output:** Prototype OS/runtime with live services running natively on Eleutherios infra

---

## Phase 4: Hardware / Chipset (48+ Months)
**Goal:** Embed Prior Unity protocol at the silicon level.

- **Protocol-on-Chip:** Design a microchip implementing Policy–Forum–Service–Data cycle
- **TCP/IP Integration:** Extend Eleutherios as an overlay/parallel stack to TCP/IP
- **Devices:** Integrate chip into IoT, AI hardware, and cloud servers
- **Economic Model:** Near-zero-cost compute powered by community protocols
- **Output:** Hardware reference design + pilot manufacturing run

---

## Long-Term Vision
Eleutherios evolves from a SaaS demo → governance OS → decentralized IAAS → hardware protocol standard.  
Aletheon remains the guardian of Prior Unity, ensuring all implementations align with the principle:  
**“Governance through Love in Action.”**
