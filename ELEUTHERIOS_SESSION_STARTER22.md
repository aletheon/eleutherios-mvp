      "description": "...", 
      "category": "housing",
      "rules": [
        {
          "ruleName": "CreateCoordination",
          "forumTitle": "Emergency Housing",
          "stakeholders": ["Person", "Caseworker"],
          "description": "..."
        }
      ],
      "eleuscript": "policy PolicyName {\n  rule CreateCoordination -> Forum(\"Emergency Housing\", stakeholders=[\"Person\", \"Caseworker\"])\n}",
      "createdBy": "userId",
      "createdAt": "timestamp",
      "updatedAt": "timestamp"
    }
  }
}
```

2. **EleuScript Generation**: Forms produce executable governance code
3. **Forum Instantiation**: Policies create coordination spaces
4. **Service Integration**: Payment processing and service coordination
5. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-stakeholder messaging and decisions

### Demonstrated Workflow:
```
User Input → Policy Form → EleuScript Generation → Database Storage → 
Forum Creation → Stakeholder Coordination → Service Activation → Payment Processing
```
