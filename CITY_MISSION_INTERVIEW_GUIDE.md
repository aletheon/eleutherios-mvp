# City Mission Emergency Accommodation Coordination Interview Guide

## Purpose
To identify specific coordination failures in emergency accommodation systems where governance tools might provide value, and to validate whether documented coordination breakdowns exist beyond current informal solutions.

---

## Intake and Bed Allocation Coordination

### Information Flow Breakdowns

**Question 1:** When someone needs emergency accommodation, how many different people or agencies do they have to contact before getting a bed?

**Question 2:** Do you ever have people who get referred by multiple agencies simultaneously, creating confusion about who's handling their case?

**Question 3:** How often do you receive incomplete information about incoming residents that forces you to re-do assessments or intake processes?

### Decision-Making Conflicts

**Question 4:** Do different agencies (WINZ, Housing NZ, health services) ever give conflicting advice to the same person about accommodation eligibility?

**Question 5:** Who makes the final decision when you have more people needing beds than available space, and do other agencies sometimes disagree with those decisions?

## Day-to-Day Operations Coordination

### Service Provider Conflicts

**Question 6:** Do residents ever receive conflicting instructions from different support workers (social workers, case managers, health workers) about what they should be doing?

**Question 7:** How do you coordinate when a resident needs medical care, mental health support, and housing assistance from different agencies simultaneously?

### Information Sharing Problems

**Question 8:** When a resident has an incident or crisis, how do you communicate that to all relevant support workers? Do any agencies miss critical information?

**Question 9:** Do you ever find out after the fact that another agency was working with the same resident on issues you weren't aware of?

---

## Discharge and Exit Coordination

### Handoff Failures

**Question 10:** Do people ever get discharged from your facility without proper housing lined up because of miscommunication between agencies?

**Question 11:** How often do residents cycle back through emergency accommodation because the transition to permanent housing wasn't properly coordinated?

### Follow-up Gaps

**Question 12:** After someone transitions out, do you ever lose track of them because no agency took clear responsibility for ongoing support?

---

## Resource and Capacity Coordination

### Operational Inefficiencies

**Question 13:** Do you ever turn people away who could have been accommodated if you'd had better information about bed availability or discharge timing?

**Question 14:** Are there times when agencies refer people to you who don't actually meet the criteria, wasting everyone's time?

---

## Measurement Questions

### Quantifying Coordination Overhead

**Question 15:** Can you estimate how many hours per week staff spend on coordination activities (phone calls, meetings, paperwork) between different agencies?

**Question 16:** What percentage of residents experience delays or complications because of poor coordination between service providers?

---

## Follow-up Questions

Based on their responses, probe deeper into:

- **Specific examples** of coordination failures they mention
- **Current workarounds** they use to manage coordination problems
- **Stakeholder relationships** that work well vs. those that are problematic
- **Technology or tools** they currently use for coordination
- **Measurable impacts** of coordination problems on residents and staff

---

## Interview Goals

The goal is to identify specific, measurable coordination failures that governance tools might address rather than general dissatisfaction with complex social services. Look for:

- **Documented coordination breakdowns** with clear operational impact
- **Multiple stakeholders** with conflicting processes or incentives  
- **Information sharing barriers** that cause service gaps
- **Decision-making conflicts** between agencies
- **Measurable inefficiencies** in current coordination methods

If coordination problems are not clearly documented or if current informal systems work reasonably well, this validates that the platform may need to focus on different coordination challenges.
