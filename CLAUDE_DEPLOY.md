Yes, you have everything you need to start a new Claude session with full context:
Essential Documents to Share:

Updated session starter (the artifact I just created) - includes fundraising context, current status, working URLs
Eleutherios Fundamentals (your core concept document)
Project summary (with the two demo workflows completed)

Key Information to Show New Claude:

Working URLs:

Main app: eleutherios-mvp.vercel.app
Pitch page: /pitch
Healthcare demo: /demo/healthcare
Housing demo: /demo/housing


Current file structure (Next.js with TypeScript)
Immediate priorities (partnership pilots vs. technical development)

What's Changed Since Last Session:

Active fundraising (pre-seed $100K-$250K)
Professional pitch materials deployed
Priority shift from pure technical development to proving product-market fit
Partnership-ready demos for healthcare providers and government agencies

The updated session starter captures your current fundraising context, working demos, and the strategic pivot toward partnership validation. A new Claude session will understand you're beyond just building demos - you're now proving the business model works with real stakeholders.
The session starter also maintains the technical context for when you want to continue development work (like the autonomous service validation engine), but correctly prioritizes partnership pilot preparation given your active fundraising.
You're well-prepared to continue with either investor/partnership conversations or technical development as needed.
